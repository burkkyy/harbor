# Disaster Recovery
If the *incident response plan*(`IRP`) and the *business continuity 
plan*(`BCP`) both fail, the *disaster recovery plan*(`DRP`) is activated 
to help the business to return to normal operations as quickly as 
possible. 

## The goal of a `DRP`
The `DR` essentially picks up where the `BCP` left off. The `DRP` guides
the actions of emergency reponse personnel until the business restored 
to full last-known reliable operations.

NOTE: Whereas business continuity planning is about maintaining critical business functions, disaster recovery planning is about restoring IT and communications back to full operations after a disruption.

# Components of a `DRP`
* Executive summary providing a high-level overview of the plan Department-specific plans
* Technical guides for IT personnel responsible for implementing and maintaining critical backup systems
* Full copies of the plan for critical disaster recovery team members checklists for certain individuals

An example of a `DRP` is the use of system backups.
