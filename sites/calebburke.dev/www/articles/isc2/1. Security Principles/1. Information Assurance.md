# Security Concepts of Information Assurance
*Security* is measured by Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability,
also referred to as the CIA triad.

## CIA triad
### *Confidentiality*
>**Confidentiality** *`defn.`* Permitting authorized access to 
> information while also protecting that information from improper 
> access.

Concepts of Confidentiality
* Personally Identifiable Information (PLL)
    * Data about an individual that could be used to identify them 
* Security
    * The measure of the importance assigned to information
    * The importance of protection of particular information
        * In most cases the more protection assigned to particular information, that more damage it would cause a organization if leaked

> `leaked` is the term for particular information being avaliable outside
> of its intended avaliability

### *Integrity*
>**Integrity** *`defn.`* The measure of correctness, accuracy and 
> consistency of information and/or data.

Concepts of Integrity
* Data integrity
    * The assurace that data has not been incorrectly altered
* System integrity
    * The assurace a system is operating expectedly and will continue to do so

### *Availability*
>**Availability** *`defn.`* Systems and data are accessible at the time 
> the data is needed

>**Criticality** *`defn.`* A measure of dependence of a particular 
> information or system

## Authentication
> Authentication *`defn.`* The process of verifying and/or proving the 
> identity of a user

> Authorization *`defn.`* The right or a permission that is granted to 
> a system entity to access a system resource.

Methods of Authentication
* Something you know
    * Passwords/passphrases
* Something you have
    * Tokens, key cards, keys etc
* Something you are
    * Biometrics
    * Facial recognition

Using one of these methods alone for authentication is know as
single-factor authentication (SFA). Using two or more of these methods
is known as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
