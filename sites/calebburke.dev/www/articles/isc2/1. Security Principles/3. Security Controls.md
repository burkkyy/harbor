Security Controls come in three parts:
1. Physical Controls
2. Technical Controls
3. Administrative Controls

## Physical Controls
Controls implemented through a tangible mechanism. Examples include 
walls, fences, guards, locks, etc. In modern organizations, many 
physical control systems are linked to technical/logical systems, such 
as badge readers connected to door locks. 

## Technical Controls
Security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an 
information system that are primarily implemented and executed by the 
information system through mechanisms contained in the hardware, 
software or firmware components of the system.

## Administrative Controls
Controls implemented through policy and procedures. Examples include 
access control processes and requiring multiple personnel to conduct a 
specific operation. Administrative controls in modern environments are 
often enforced in conjunction with physical and/or technical controls, 
such as an access-granting policy for new users that requires login and 
approval by the hiring manager.
