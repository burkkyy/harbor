# Network Threats and Attacks
There are many types of cyber threats. Here are the most common types:

| | |
|--|--|
| Spoofing | An attack with the goal of gaining access to a target system through the use of a falsified identity. Spoofing can be used against IP addresses, MAC address, usernames, system names, wireless network SSIDs, email addresses, and many other types of logical identification. |
| Phishing | An attack that attempts to misdirect legitimate users to malicious websites through the abuse of URLs or hyperlinks in emails could be considered phishing. |
| DOS/DDOS | A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a network resource consumption attack that has the primary goal of preventing legitimate activity on a victimized system. Attacks involving numerous unsuspecting secondary victim systems are known as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. |
| Virus | The computer virus is perhaps the earliest form of malicious code to plague security administrators. As with biological viruses, computer viruses have two main functions—propagation and destruction. A virus is a self-replicating piece of code that spreads without the consent of a user, but frequently with their assistance (a user has to click on a link or open a file). |
| Worm | Worms pose a significant risk to network security. They contain the same destructive potential as other malicious code objects with an added twist—they propagate themselves without requiring any human intervention. |
| Trojan | Named after the ancient story of the Trojan horse, the Trojan is a software program that appears benevolent but carries a malicious, behind-the-scenes payload that has the potential to wreak havoc on a system or network. For example, ransomware often uses a Trojan to infect a target machine and then uses encryption technology to encrypt documents, spreadsheets and other files stored on the system with a key known only to the malware creator. |
| On-path Attack | In an on-path attack, attackers place themselves between two devices, often between a web browser and a web server, to intercept or modify information that is intended for one or both of the endpoints. On-path attacks are also known as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. |
| Side-channel | A side-channel attack is a passive, noninvasive attack to observe the operation of a device. Methods include power monitoring, timing and fault analysis attacks. |
| Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) | Advanced persistent threat (APT) refers to threats that demonstrate an unusually high level of technical and operational sophistication spanning months or even years. APT attacks are often conducted by highly organized groups of attackers. |
| Insider Threat | Insider threats are threats that arise from individuals who are trusted by the organization. These could be disgruntled employees or employees involved in espionage. Insider threats are not always willing participants. A trusted user who falls victim to a scam could be an unwilling insider threat. |
| Malware | A program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the victim’s data, applications or operating system or otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim. |
| Ransomware | Malware used for the purpose of facilitating a ransom attack. Ransomware attacks often use cryptography to “lock” the files on an affected computer and require the payment of a ransom fee in return for the “unlock” code. |

## Preventing Attacks
While there is no single step you can take to protect against all 
threats, there are some basic steps you can take that help reduce the 
risk of many types of threats.

* Keep systems and applications up to date. Vendors regularly release patches to correct bugs and security flaws, but these only help when they are applied. Patch management ensures that systems and applications are kept up to date with relevant patches. 
* Remove or disable unneeded services and protocols. If a system doesn’t need a service or protocol, it should not be running. Attackers cannot exploit a vulnerability in a service or protocol that isn’t running on a system. As an extreme contrast, imagine a web server is running every available service and protocol. It is vulnerable to potential attacks on any of these services and protocols. 
* Use intrusion detection and prevention systems. As discussed, intrusion detection and prevention systems observe activity, attempt to detect threats and provide alerts. They can often block or stop attacks.  
* Use up-to-date anti-malware software. We have already covered the various types of malicious code such as viruses and worms. A primary countermeasure is anti-malware software.  
* Use firewalls. Firewalls can prevent many different types of threats. Network-based firewalls protect entire networks, and host-based firewalls protect individual systems. This chapter included a section describing how firewalls can prevent attacks. 

An `intrusion` occurs when an attacker is able to bypass or thwart 
security mechanisms and gain access to an organization’s resources. 
Intrusion detection is a specific form of monitoring that monitors 
recorded information and real-time events to detect abnormal activity 
indicating a potential incident or intrusion. An `intrusion detection 
system (IDS)` automates the inspection of logs and real-time system 
events to detect intrusion attempts and system failures. An `IDS` is 
intended as part of a defense-in-depth security plan. It will work with, 
and complement, other security mechanisms such as firewalls, but it does 
not replace them. 

## Terminology
> **IDS** *`defn.`* An intrusion detection system is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.

> **HIDS** *`defn.`* A Host-based Intrusion Detection System monitors activity on a single computer, including process calls and information recorded in system, application, security and host-based firewall logs.

> **NIDS** *`defn.`* A Network Intrusion Detection System monitors and evaluates network activity to detect attacks or event anomalies. It cannot monitor the content of encrypted traffic but can monitor other packet details.

> **SIEM** *`defn.`* Security management involves the use of tools that collect information about the IT environment from many disparate sources to better examine the overall security of the organization and streamline security efforts. These tools are generally known as *security information and event management* (or S-I-E-M, pronounced “SIM”) solutions. The general idea of a SIEM solution is to gather log data from various sources across the enterprise to better understand potential security concerns and apportion resources accordingly. SIEM systems can be used along with other components (defense-in-depth) as part of an overall information security program.

> **IPS** *`defn.`* An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is a special type of active IDS that automatically attempts to detect and block attacks before they reach target systems. A distinguishing difference between an IDS and an IPS is that the IPS is placed in line with the traffic. In other words, all traffic must pass through the IPS and the IPS can choose what traffic to forward and what traffic to block after analyzing it. This allows the IPS to prevent an attack from reaching a target. Since IPS systems are most effective at preventing network-based attacks, it is common to see the IPS function integrated into firewalls. Just like IDS, there are Network-based IPS (NIPS) and Host-based IPS (HIPS).
