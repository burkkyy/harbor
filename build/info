# Script to print out info from other build scripts.
#
# Please keep in mind I only wrote this script to work for just npm commands and 
# info from other scripts in this directory.

# Get info string from argv, otherwise from stdin
[ $# -ne 0 ] && info=$1 || info=$(cat -)

# Print out the info, with color
echo -e "\e[1;34m[-]\e[0m $info"

# Exit with code 0, aka success
exit 0
