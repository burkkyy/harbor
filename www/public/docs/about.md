# About
Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Caleb and I am a university student pursuing a computer science degree.

On this website I will be showcasing some of my projects I am working. \
Along with this I will also be posting a collection of random things I take interest in. This websites theme is heavily insirped by the [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).\
\
This website is a collection of random ideas, so some pages may be\
rendered and look different than others. This way done on purpose to utilize different
technologies.
\
\
Pages:\
&emsp;&emsp;Home : Landing page\
&emsp;&emsp;Museum : Collection of important objects/art in history\
&emsp;&emsp;Library : My perspective on certain movies/books\
&emsp;&emsp;About : This page\
\
Thanks for stopping by,\
Caleb
